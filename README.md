GooglePalettes
======

What is this?
-----
I needed the color palette from the Google design guidelines (located [here](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Google-Visual-Assets-Guidelines-Part-1/9028077)) and decided to make my own preset.

What programs are supported?
-----
Currently only Paint.NET and GIMP (Inkscape uses the same format as GIMP)

However, if someone would like to figure out how to convert them to other formats, feel free to request a pull.

How do I install these palettes?
