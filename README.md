GooglePalettes
======

What is this?
-----
I needed the color palette from the Google design guidelines (located [here](http://www.behance.net/gallery/Google-Visual-Assets-Guidelines-Part-1/9028077)) and decided to make my own set of presets.
These are pre-Material Design.

What programs can I use these with?
-----
Currently only Paint.NET and GIMP are supported. (Inkscape uses the same palette format as GIMP)

However, if someone would like to figure out how to convert them to other formats, feel free to fork and I can merge it in.

How do I install these palettes?
